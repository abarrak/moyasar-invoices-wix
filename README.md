Wix [does not support 3DS](https://support.wix.com/en/article/request-implementing-3d-secure-payments) at the time of writing.

## TODO

- Add secondary integration path using [wix-users API](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-users.html) for probable other cases.
- Integrate [wix-router](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-router.html) for receiving notification service.
