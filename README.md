# Moyasar Wix

This is a minimalist plugin to integrate Moyasar Invoices system with Wix Platform.


## Overview

Use this solution to add simple to advanced invoicing system to websites built using Wix.

It leverages their Wix Code APIs for the backend and frontend.

## Installation Guide

Follow [the guide here](https://github.com/moyasar/moyasar-wix/master/invoices-integration.md).


## Moyasar Sample Shop

[This is a sample store](https://abarrak.wixsite.com/moyasar-dev-store/sample-invoice) to carry on development and testing.

## Moyasar as Shop Payment Provider

This is not available currently in Wix.

They offer sending [new gateway request to be voted on](https://support.wix.com/en/accepting-payments/setting-up-your-payments#feature-requests), and added if approved though.

Wix [does not support 3DS](https://support.wix.com/en/article/request-implementing-3d-secure-payments) at the time of writing.

## TODO

- Add secondary integration path using [wix-users API](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-users.html) for probable future cases.
- Integrate [wix-router](https://www.wix.com/code/reference/wix-router.html) for notification service to bing client system if needed.
